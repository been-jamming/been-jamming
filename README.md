Hi, I'm Ben! I do theoretical math at ASU, and when time permits, I also do some programming.
Here is a list of my favorite projects I've done:
1. [CORE](https://github.com/been-jamming/CORE): my proof assistant
2. [Topographs](https://been-jamming.github.io/topographs): an animated website for interacting with topographs of integral quadratic forms
3. [MinimalCC](https://github.com/been-jamming/MinimalCC): a dead simple, fast C subset compiler written in 3000 lines of C
4. [QR-util](https://github.com/been-jamming/QR-util): a command line utility for generating QR code bitmaps
5. [rubiks_cube](https://github.com/been-jamming/rubiks_cube): a terminal application which lets you solve a 3d rubik's cube
